1	Project  Introduction
This project aims to predict rainfall using machine learning based on weather data. It incorporates parameters such as precipitation, temperature (both max and min), wind speed, and humidity to provide an accurate forecast of possible weather outcomes, including drizzle, fog, rain, snow, and sun. The project utilizes a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model with an optimized algorithm to predict weather based on the input features.

2	Aim
The main aim of this project is to create an automated system that predicts rainfall using historical weather data and to provide these predictions in an easy-to-use web interface. It leverages machine learning to assist users in making informed decisions, such as scheduling activities, preparing for bad weather, or managing agricultural resources.

3	Use Cases
The platform supports several use cases, including:
•	Weather Forecasting:  Helps predict rain and other weather conditions using past data.
•	Agriculture: Farmers can utilize this system to predict rainfall for irrigation planning.
•	Public Safety: Authorities can be forewarned of possible adverse weather conditions.

4	Project Structure
The project is structured into two main parts: the frontend, developed using HTML, CSS, and the backend, developed using Python .

4.1	Frontend 
The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and Flask's templating engine. Users can input the weather parameters (precipitation, max temperature, min temperature, wind speed, and humidity) and receive predicted weather conditions as output. 

4.2	Backend (Spring Boot)
The backend consists of a Flask web framework serving a machine learning model. This model uses a KNN classifier trained on historical weather data to predict outcomes. The backend processes user inputs, scales the data, feeds it to the trained model, and returns the result to the frontend.


5	User Training
To ensure effective use of the Citizen Service Request Platform, the following training materials are provided:

5.1	Getting Started Guide
•	Clone the repository to your local machine
•	Install the necessary dependencies.
pip install -r requirements.txt

5.2	FAQ
•	Q: What happens if I enter invalid data?
A: The system expects numerical inputs for the weather parameters. Invalid data will return an error message.
•	Q: What is the basis for the prediction?
A: The prediction is based on a KNN model trained on historical weather data, taking into account precipitation, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
•	Q: How accurate is the prediction?
A: The accuracy of the model is approximately 85%, based on testing using the weather dataset.
